Wordpress Naked was built by [Freelance PHP Developer Darren Beale](http://bealers.com/freelance-php-developer-darren-beale/) in 2009 as a simple Wordpress theme to assist developers that need to quickly implement a blog using Wordpress but don't really have the time to spend looking under the hood in any detail or reading documentation when it comes to applying a custom theme (e.g. their clients' design).

The aim with Naked is that a developer with an XHTML template that they've already developed can very quickly apply it to this no-frills theme with the minimum of fuss and research.

The main features of Naked are:

  * Lightweight, semantic and validating XHTML
  * As minimal as we can make it CSS to support the two column layout, which you can of course change in minutes to suit your CSS; the CSS is commnted to assist more in this regard
  * Page navigation is two level horizontal unordered lists which you can easily change

With an eye on SEO:
  * The site title and strap line are H1 on the homepage and H4 on internal
  * The HTML `<title>` contains the site name on homepage and the post title on internal pages
  * The post titles are H2 on the homepage and H1 on their standalone pages
  * Widget friendly
  * Gravatar friendly

To install:
  1. [download a compressed file](http://code.google.com/p/wordpress-naked/downloads/list) or [export the lastest from svn](http://code.google.com/p/wordpress-naked/source/checkout)
  1. place the resulting folder into your wp-content/themes directory
  1. activate the theme from within the Wordpress 'Appearance' menu
